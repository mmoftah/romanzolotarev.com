# OpenBSD 6.4 and ssg3

Hi there!

As you may know, few days ago [OpenBSD 6.4 has been
released](https://www.openbsd.org/64.html), so I've updated related
how-tos:

- [Enable HTTPS with acme-client(1) and Let's Encrypt on OpenBSD](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/acme-client.html)
- [Upgrade OpenBSD on bare metal](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/upgrade.html)
- [Publish Git repositories with stagit(1) on OpenBSD](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/stagit.html)

... and added new ones:

- [Upgrade OpenBSD on OpenBSD.Amsterdam](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/oams-upgrade.html)
- [Upgrade OpenBSD on Vultr](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/vultr-upgrade.html)
- [Generate random string with random(4)](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/random.html)

Let me know if you find them helpful.

More people has started using my static site generator this month.
Thank you, brave folks! You were confused when `ssg2` has ignored
pages without `<H1>` tag, and you're right, this is confusing. My
bad. Let me fix that for you. Here is the solution:
[ssg3](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html)

> `ssg3` wraps all pages without `<HTML>` tag.<br>
`ssg3` still uses `<H1>` tag to fetch titles, but `<H1>` tag is
optional.

> A minor improvement: [lowdown(1)](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/)
is optional now.<br>
It's required only if there are `*.md` files.
