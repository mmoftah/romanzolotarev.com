# Making the Web

Hi, I'm restarting [my newsletter](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/n/).

and companies.
- Published [over 50 BSD user stories](https://www.bsdjobs.com/people/)
(ping me, if you want to share yours).
- Updated [my setup](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/setup.html).

[OpenBSD Amsterdam](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd.amsterdam/) and
