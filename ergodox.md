# ErgoDox

The ErgoDox is a DIY keyboard project initiated by Dominic Beauchamp.
The design is ergonomic, split in two separate halves with a columnar
layout.

I've been a happy user of [ErgoDox
EZ](https://people.ergodox-ez.com/roman-zolotarev/) since 2016.
It's my favorite part of [the setup](/setup.html).

(and one red DSA keycap), tilt kit._

**Why EZ, not DIY kit?** High build-quality. Wrist rest and tilt kit.
Excellent service. 2-year warranty. I have chosen Cherry MX Brown
switches, blank DCS keycaps, and my custom layout.

**Cherry MX Brown** are good for typing and not that loud as blue ones.

My typing accuracy is at its best with **DCS** keycaps. I tried DSA
for a month or so, but then returned to sculpted keycaps so my
fingers always know where they are.

I picked **blank keycaps**, because when I'm typing I look at my
screen, not my keyboard.

**Tilt kit and wrist rest** is absolute must have. Don't know how
other ErdoDox users survive without them.

## Layout

On ErgoDox I use [Norman layout](/norman-layout.html).

[Download the layout from
ergodox-ez.com](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/ldzaea/edit)

Tips and hints:

- **Vim key** works this way: tap for `ESC` or hold to use it as `CTRL`.
- To activate N-rollover hold left and right `SHIFT`, then press `N`.
- To activate Mouse layer hold `TT1`.
- To toggle between layers press and release `TT1`.
